# Truck Trippo!
## Gitting rdy

Next week marks the start of my summer holidays! I’m planning on hitting the road in my truck where I’ve converted the back into a camper.  So I've started a blog on my Github hence the Gitting rdy in the title of this post. I've added the “po” to the end of “trip” to make Trippo, mostly because my truck reminds me of a hippo.  Depicted in the image below:

Nevertheless (is a neat word) I'm going to keep a daily journal of my travels. Check back for more posts about silly oberservations and doodles, maybe some pictures.  For now I will leave you with this piece of historical Canadian cinematography.
You will also need a fast internet connection for online meetings and possibly the remote operation of a Sheridan Workstation.  High-speed internet is generally about 50mbs download and 10mbs upload speed.  This is the ideal speed for online working, although; you may be able to work with speeds of 12mbs Download and 4mbs upload. To check your internet connection speed, go to fast.com and from there make upgrades to your internet service as needed. Below is a link to a detailed document on internet speeds and services.
