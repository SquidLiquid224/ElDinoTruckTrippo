# Truck Trippo!
## Gitting rdy

Next week marks the start of my summer holidays! I’m planning on hitting the road in my truck where I’ve converted the back into a camper.  So I've started a blog on my Github hence the Gitting rdy in the title of this post. I've added the “po” to the end of “trip” to make Trippo, mostly because my truck reminds me of a hippo.  Depicted in the image below:

Nevertheless (is a neat word) I'm going to keep a daily journal of my travels. Check back for more posts about silly oberservations and doodles, maybe some pictures.  For now I will leave you with this piece of historical Canadian cinematography.

So I made the ultimate Supersoaker water bazooka!  That can also be used as a portable water tank for washing stuff.. like muddy shoes, the truck, if you're brave you could use it as a shower.. you could even water plants! Anyways, it was pretty cool to see it work, Here is a picture of the initial test:

I've never experimented with plumbing, it was fun sticking little tubes together.  The dude at the plumbing store was super helpful with my wack McGuyver water tank.  Kudos to that dude.  Next up I'm finishing up the cap, hopefully tomorrow I can get it put back together.
